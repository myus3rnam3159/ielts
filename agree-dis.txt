It is sometimes suggested that goverments should impose a ban on advertisements targeted at children. This essay strongly agrees with this suggestion for several reasons

The first reason to support my opinion is that these advertisement could contain violent or explicit contents being inappropriate for children. This is because in modern life, due to advanced internet technologies, social media advertisements are effectively created on a large scale without approval from any authorities. In addition, children tend to imitate what they see, which means that they might copy violent or dangerous behaviors on commercials. This can be seen in game studios releasing new game trailers that have a large number of gory fight scenes to attract children audiences. As a result, these youngsters often demonstrate aggressive activities so parents have to block such videos away from their loved ones.

Another point behind my belief is that advertising corporations often tell lies in order to grow their sales for their parters. Simply because, in today business, owners usually priortize profit, so most advertisements will showcase the good sides of products and try to hide the negative effect on children health. One prime example of this is the fast food industry in which several major brands such as McDonaldâ€™s and KFC are creating several TV commercials to entice more children into consuming their products. This can cause several children to consume unhealthy fast food items on a regular basis, which can bring about various adverse effects on health such as an increasing risk of childhood and other cardiovascular diseases. For this reason, I believe that banning companies from advertising harmful products to children can lower these health risks.

In conclusion, I totally agree that governments should prohibit companies from creating advertisements targeting or featuring children.
